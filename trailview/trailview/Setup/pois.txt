# This file is used to describe the points of interest for a trail.
# The format is as follows:
# {[StartPanoNumber] or None,
# [EndPanoNumber] or None,
# [Name surrounded by single quotes],
# [Category (see below)],
# [id of Trail the PoI belongs to],
# [file name for image surrounded by single quotes] or None,
# [file name for audio surrounded by single quotes] or None,
# [Description surrounded by single quotes] or None}
#
# The exact formatting of each group is very important.
# Each object is captured by a very specific regex so it must conform.
# You may have to alter the particulars for a string (particularly
# the description). I defined each to suit the current needs of the
# text, but if you add special characters (punctuations, hyphens, etc.)
# you may have to add it to the regex for that section.
